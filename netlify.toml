[build]
  # Netlify typically runs `npm install` automatically if a package.json is present.
  # You can specify a build command here if needed, e.g., command = "npm run build"
  publish = "public"  # Assumes your static frontend assets (HTML, CSS, client-side JS) are in the 'public' directory.

# For a Node.js backend like server.js, Netlify often deploys it as a serverless function.
# This might require placing server.js (or an adapted version) in a 'netlify/functions' directory
# and potentially adding redirect rules below to route API requests to this function.
# Example for functions:
# [functions]
#   directory = "netlify/functions"

# Example redirect for an API if server.js is a function named 'api':
# [[redirects]]
#  from = "/api/*"
#  to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
#  status = 200
